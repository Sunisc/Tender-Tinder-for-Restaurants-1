<h2>Getting started</h2>

Welcome to Tender! The best place to find your favorite restaurant!

To get started. Clone this repository, on your local machine. 

After opening up Tender in your favorite editor,
run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.

Then `npm install react-scripts`, to initiate the react components to work.

Afterwards there are two steps to initiate the server!

<h3>Step 1: Creating the backend server.</h3>

Open a new terminal in your editor.
Run `npm run dev-live-reload`
This will initiate a server on your localhost's machine on port 3000.

<h3>Step 2: Launching the frontend.</h3>

Open a new terminal in your editor.
Run `npm start`
This will initiate your frontend on a free port and allow for interaction!

That's it, you're ready to find your favorite restaurant!

Our app has the functionality to search for restaurants in your area and gives the ability to 
redirect you to the restaurant. 

Users who choose to create an account with the site have the ability to save restaurants for later 
as well as blacklist restaurants that they do not wish to see filtering them from their restaurant feed.
